# Secant-Method
Gauss Partial Pivoting Algorithm in Matlab

 This could be better implemented but was the first time I tried Matlab
 N starts at 2, because the row 1, is used to do some calculations, this  does not change the performance
 
 Example
 secante(8*exp(x)*sin(x)-1,0.3,0.5,0.2,0.11199053)
